我做了一个很长的梦
梦里如同局外人看着你发生的一切
我却无奈 无力
只有撕心裂肺的哭泣
后 找一僻静之处，仍有人叨扰 耳边嘈杂
良久
梦醒了
我眼角挂不住那两行晶莹缺苦涩的泪水
提笔 记录阐述
就此消失在我的世界

I had a long dream
It's like an outsider watching everything happen to you
I was helpless
Only teas tearing at the heart
Then find a quiet place, there are still people to hear the noise
A good while
Wake up from dream
I can not hold the two lines of glittering and bitter tears
Write down and explain
Disappeared into my world
